Flutter Project which Include Drawer Menu, Images, and Layout Design
This project is prepared for my completed course, covering topics taught in my lessons. 
You can find a basic Flutter web application in this repository. 
If you wish, you can also watch this video (https://youtu.be/YjqhS3R74SM?si=bVz9kTdIGQh8VBF0), from which I benefited. Except that all the code belongs to me, and you can use it however you want.
