# flutterwebapp0
Flutter Project which Include Drawer Menu, Images, and Layout Design
This project is prepared for my completed course, covering topics taught in my lessons. 
You can find a basic Flutter web application in this repository. 
If you wish, you can also watch this video (https://youtu.be/YjqhS3R74SM?si=bVz9kTdIGQh8VBF0), from which I benefited. Except that all the code belongs to me, and you can use it however you want.


First you go your command prompt and create new flutter project with use this "flutter create yourprojectname"
And open that project that you create in code editor
I use VSCode for developing Flutter apps
I add only some folder and file that need to be changed
You can copy and then paste it into your project directory
So thats it! Have a nice day :)
